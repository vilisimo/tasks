# About
This is a simple command line tool to enable creating keeping track of tasks that need to be done.

# But why
The major reason for this project is to have a simple project that allows some degree of experimentation. 
While the logic of an app is not particularly perplexing, it allows to gain, improve and solidify knowledge 
about:
* Java (8/9)
* SQL
* HSQLDB
* JDBC
* Liquibase
* Log4j2
* Maven
* Commons CLI
* Design patters

If something useful comes out of it, all the better for it.
